How many times thought-out university do you say “ there’s just not enough time”. How many all nighters, how many lost weekends, how many “just one more cup of coffee”? Surely there has to be a better way to avoid, the inevitable burn out, a more sustainable way to plow through the work load. Well although this post doesn’t pretend to have all the answers, there are a few habits that you can build to help you work smarter and juggle your time better as you work on your projects.

## Tips for sucess

### 1. To Do List 
Before beginning the project plan prep plot! Map out a plan of action, the route that you need to follow, breaking down step by step what you need to achieve. Budget your time, allowing enough to complete each step. This gives you a clear path to follow as you work on your project, but it also gives you satisfaction as you tick off your accomplishments, and motivation when you look back to see your progress! 

### 2. Remove Your Distractions 
Be honest with yourself about what your distractions are, social media being a big one. Humans can’t actually multi-task and every time you take your focus away from the project to check Instagram, Facebook or WhatsApp, it takes the brain 60 seconds to refocus on the project after going back to it. One minute might not sound like a lot, but if you check your phone every 15 minutes, over a 10 hour day, you waste 40min just on refocusing your brain, that’s not even taking account of scrolling time! So do yourself a favour, remove the temptation, leave your phone in the other room, quit WhatsApp on your desktop, create an environment where you’re allowing your brain to focus!

### 3. Take frequent Breaks
With that all said, the brain can’t work at effectively and efficiently going at full speed for hours on end, so schedule in breaks. There is a difference between being in the zone, producing good work and forcing yourself to push on when progress is slowing and the quality is degreasing. Have the courage to STOP. Stand up, stretch your legs, get some fresh air, fresh coffee, a bite to eat, take care of you body and mind, remove yourself from the screen and from the project for a bit. Then, when your ready return to it refreshed and maybe you’ll find yourself in the zone once more!

### 4. Time Limit
If you allocate 8 hours to complete a task, it will take 8 hours, if you allocate 1 hour for a task, it will take 1 hour. Work out realistically how long a task should take, and set yourself a time limit; A point when you tell yourself it has to be done by. You’ll work much more efficiently than if there’s no time limit, you’ll also stop making unnecessary changes when the perfectionist in you takes over, at the end.

### 5. Set Yourself up to Succeed

Create a work space that works for you, find a good playlist that keeps your energy high, drink plenty of water in between the numerous coffees, and get plenty of sleep! Then encourage yourself with small rewards, celebrate the wins, fixing that bug, writing that paragraph. Manufacture a positive working culture for yourself, this will keep you motivated and sustains you all the way to the deadline!
