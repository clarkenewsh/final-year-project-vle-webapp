You’ve got your brief, ideas are sparking in your brain, you want to get started building that project, but… Wait, do not forget the the key stage in any project: Research. If you were just building a project to serve your own purpose, then building it based of your own interpretations would be fine. However there would be very little point to that! Projects need to be research driven in order to create a product that is going to achieve its purpose and meet the need of the user. 

So armed with that knowledge prioritise a period of research when you begin a new project, budget it into your time schedule, this will save you time later, give your work a clear direction and objective, and ensures that you don’t waste time developing something you don’t need or building a product that is not fit for purpose!

So what’s the best way to research for a project? 

## Tips for sucess
    
### 1. Plan of Action

The mammoth task of research can seem very overwhelming when you first sit down to begin, so plan out what you need to discover, know who you need to gather research from and prepare your discovery with care.

### 2. Set at Schedule

Set a target for when you will have collected all your research, if your research period drags on, building the project will become more and more stressful. Keep on top of the research you need, the research you’ve received and the discovery you have found from that research. This will ensure you’re using your time efficiently and keeps it available to you when you begin building.

### 3. Choose a Research Methodology

One option is a mixed methodology approach which would generate qualitative and quantitative data. There is a benefit to both open and closed questions, on the one hand, closed questions provide for tighter statistics, on the other, open questions can be really useful for getting to the core of the user’s need and prompts new insights that may be beyond your own imagination.

### 4. Be Open to Surprising Responses
This is where you see how key research before building truly is, because while you might have a good idea about the research you are going to find when you start, sometimes people can surprise you with different responses than you expected. It’s important that you recognise these differences and be willing to adjust you concepts for the project to incorporate these findings into the development! 

### 5. Take Advantage of Available Resources
This could be a mixture of external tools and software on the web or utilising your undergraduate peers to undertake your research. Remember when conducting research with peers to make sure to assess the legal, social and ethical considerations.
