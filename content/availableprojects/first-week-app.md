# Project Brief 

Create a mobile app (using web technologies) that can be used by fresherâ€™s during their first
few weeks at Uni. The app needs to provide all of their relevant information for them. Show
them around campus using webAR technology. The content needs to be researched (what is
actually needed, wanted), and then created from scratch (including all text and
images/photos and any storage needed (DB, JSON)). The design of the site should then be
created from scratch to a high level (look professional and using design paradigms).
Interaction should be designed. The designs should then be built (using BDD for high marks).
Once built it should be user tested and results written up. (NOTE:-- this should not be a static
site)
