# Project Brief 

Design and build a website of about 10 pages+ (you need a decent amount of original
content on each page). Using the Annyang library or equivalent build in voice control and
then test and iterate the website and the voice controls so that the finished version of the
site is as useable as possible with as little cognitive load as required by the user (we do not
want them to have to learn what to say, or read it from the screen but be as natural as
possible). (https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/354324.354345 )

## Project Requiremnets
All projects below are vague in the description and are guidelines for a discussion
with the web programme leader. None of these should be attempted without first
chatting and firming up a direction with him.
The idea is that you research your ideal job by looking at the current live job specs and assessing
what they want and what you can currently opffer and then we will try and carve a project from
one the following topics that will enable you to be ready to apply for jobs like the one you want.

1. Project management (whole project)
2. Extensive background research in both literature (some of the ideas have a starting paper or two linked) and inspiration (layouts, fonts, colours, features).
3. Understanding of research and development methodologies and how they are linked (decide on which ones you will use.. It will a number not less than 3).
4. Primary research and analysis that informs the requirements of the build
5. Plan and use version control
6. Website or app content gathering and creation
7. Design of the interface (experiments - lots of experiments (font choices, colour choice, to create a style guide) layout structure, information architecture, )
8. Design (calls to action identification - user stories, personas, customer story mapping, ( https://uxplanet.org/my-10-step-ux-ui-workflow-2019-74bb78723414 )
9. Build of artefact (semantic HTML, CSS grid + sub-grid, dynamic data source (from cms you build, API or a structured JSON file).
10. Technical Testing (TDD/BDD, user testing, expert testing, performance testing (chrome dev tools and lighthouse, accessibility testing)
11. Post-build research to see if the site works for the purpose designed (not technicall but objectively (Does the site meet your aim and objectives?)
12. Final analysis
13. Write up (latex - using overleaf, refs in bib file from google scholar)

## Top Tip
#### The build should be much more than you have ever been asked to do or done in any other module.
