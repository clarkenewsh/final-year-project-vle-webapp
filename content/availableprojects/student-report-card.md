# Project Brief 
This web based dashboard shows data fed from DB or JSON that mimics BB data (no real
data can be used). The dashboard should show all attendance for all modules as well as
module marks with a breakdown of stats that show a student how they are doing and
provide automated coaching advice on how they can improve (you will need to explore your
own ideas for these stats) using charts js for the animated and interactive data. Include a
degree classification calculator that allows for the student to experiment with their
outstanding coursework marks to see what they need. You may also wat to consider looking
into chatbots to aid the coaching part. This is not a simple interface and should be really
thought about and planned and lots of experiments and user testing to prove the
interface(s) does what is required) (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10758-017-

## Project Requiremnets
All projects below are vague in the description and are guidelines for a discussion
with the web programme leader. None of these should be attempted without first
chatting and firming up a direction with him.
The idea is that you research your ideal job by looking at the current live job specs and assessing
what they want and what you can currently opffer and then we will try and carve a project from
one the following topics that will enable you to be ready to apply for jobs like the one you want.
<div class="text-block">
1) Project management (whole project)
</div>
<div class="text-block">
2) extensive background research in both literature (some of the ideas have a starting
paper or two linked) and inspiration (layouts, fonts, colours, features).
</div>
<div class="text-block">
3) Understanding of research and development methodologies and how they are linked.
(decide on which ones you will use.. It will a number not less than 3)
</div>
<div class="text-block">
4) Primary research and analysis that informs the requirements of the build
</div>
<div class="text-block">
5) Plan and use version control
</div>
<div class="text-block">
6) Website or app content gathering and creation
</div>
<div class="text-block">
7) Design of the interface (experiments - lots of experiments (font choices, colour
choice, to create a style guide) layout structure, information architecture, )
</div>
<div class="text-block">
8) design (calls to action identification - user stories, personas, customer story
mapping, ( https://uxplanet.org/my-10-step-ux-ui-workflow-2019-74bb78723414 ))
</div>
<div class="text-block">
9) Build of artefact (semantic HTML, CSS grid + sub-grid, dynamic data source (from
cms you build, API or a structured JSON file)
</div>
<div class="text-block">
10) Technical Testing (TDD/BDD, user testing, expert testing, performance testing
(chrome dev tools and lighthouse, accessibility testing)
</div>
<div class="text-block">
11) Post-build research to see if the site works for the purpose designed (not technically
but objectively (Does the site meet your aim and objectives?)
</div>
<div class="text-block">
12) Final analysis
</div>
<div class="text-block">
13) Write up (latex - using overleaf, refs in bib file from google scholar)
</div>


<div class="text-block border-text-block">
TOP TIP: The build should be much more than you have ever
been asked to do or done in any other module.
