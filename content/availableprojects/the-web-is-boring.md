# Project Brief 
All websites today fit into one of two design layouts, use the same fonts and interactions.
This project is to investigate and re-design the web. The topic of the site can be anything you
want but must be 10+ pages of real content (ideally unique content that you research and
create from scratch). The design should be unique as should the interactions. Yet this should 
still be usable and make sense. (You may use novel interactions via the different inputs on
different devices for example e.g. tilt, turn on tablets and mobiles to navigate a 3d space or
jolt the device for pushing buttons or it could be that you create an immersive continuous
interaction throughout all pages a sort of little like a first player shoot â€˜em up game). Look at
this web app created for royal caribbean by (https://dribbble.com/shots/6162925-RoyalCaribbean-App-Navigation-Explore) to give you an idea of were to go with this. Also you
can watch this to get inspired: https://youtu.be/AonZeJFsaxc. You may also wish to
explore the use of 3D objects in your designs as this is very sort after right now.

## Project Requirements
All projects below are vague in the description and are guidelines for a discussion
with the web programme leader. None of these should be attempted without first
chatting and firming up a direction with him.
The idea is that you research your ideal job by looking at the current live job specs and assessing
what they want and what you can currently offer and then we will try and carve a project from
one the following topics that will enable you to be ready to apply for jobs like the one you want.
<div class="text-block">
1) Project management (whole project)
</div>
<div class="text-block">
2) extensive background research in both literature (some of the ideas have a starting
paper or two linked) and inspiration (layouts, fonts, colours, features).
</div>
<div class="text-block">
3) Understanding of research and development methodologies and how they are linked.
(decide on which ones you will use.. It will a number not less than 3)
</div>
<div class="text-block">
4) Primary research and analysis that informs the requirements of the build
</div>
<div class="text-block">
5) Plan and use version control
</div>
<div class="text-block">
6) Website or app content gathering and creation
</div>
<div class="text-block">
7) Design of the interface (experiments - lots of experiments (font choices, colour
choice, to create a style guide) layout structure, information architecture, )
</div>
<div class="text-block">
8) design (calls to action identification - user stories, personas, customer story
mapping, ( https://uxplanet.org/my-10-step-ux-ui-workflow-2019-74bb78723414 ))
</div>
<div class="text-block">
9) Build of artefact (semantic HTML, CSS grid + sub-grid, dynamic data source (from
cms you build, API or a structured JSON file)
</div>
<div class="text-block">
10) Technical Testing (TDD/BDD, user testing, expert testing, performance testing
(chrome dev tools and lighthouse, accessibility testing)
</div>
<div class="text-block">
11) Post-build research to see if the site works for the purpose designed (not technically
but objectively (Does the site meet your aim and objectives?)
</div>
<div class="text-block">
12) Final analysis
</div>
<div class="text-block">
13) Write up (latex - using overleaf, refs in bib file from google scholar)
</div>


<div class="text-block border-text-block">
TOP TIP: The build should be much more than you have ever
been asked to do or done in any other module.
