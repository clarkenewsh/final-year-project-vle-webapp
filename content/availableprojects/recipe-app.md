# Project Brief 

numerous celebrity chef areas each with their own recipes listed that can be added to the
keep area of the app. When looking at the recipes the user can click add to a shopping list
and it will add the required ingredients to a shopping list. If the item already exists then the
quantity is increased (e.g. if you have spag bol in the list it will have mincemeat (500g) then
you add lasagne to the list the mincemeat will not be listed twice but instead increased to
(1500g). The celebrity chef areas can be selected from a catalogue of chefs and are only
downloaded and listed in the app if the users want them. Each chef has a background image,
logo and list of recipes. All recipes in the catalogue can be searched using free or facets.
