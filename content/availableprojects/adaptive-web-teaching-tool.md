# Project Brief 

This site can be either PHP or JS based but has a frontend tutorial user interface and
backend tutor settings panel.
You should develop a detailed step by step tutorial site to teach modern web design theory
and practice to prospective uni students on a visit day (practical exercise should not take a
prospective student more than 3 hours to complete but by the end they should have a good
basic knowledge of layout, grid design as well as HTML CSS (CSS-grid) coding.
The final app/site should be something that looks professional but represents Edge Hill
university. Ideally, this tool will have multiple options set so the tutor can turn things on and
off in the tutor dashboard and as these change the tutorial (text and instruction) and end
design changes. E.g. if the CSS grid option is turned off then there is an alternative CSS fall
back in place that changes in the tutorial but the layout stays the same. But if a banner is
turned off then the layout changes as does the tutorial. For this, you need to think modular
in both the tutorial system and the make-up of your CSS and tutorial parts.

## Project Requiremnets
All projects below are vague in the description and are guidelines for a discussion
with the web programme leader. None of these should be attempted without first
chatting and firming up a direction with him.
The idea is that you research your ideal job by looking at the current live job specs and assessing
what they want and what you can currently opffer and then we will try and carve a project from
one the following topics that will enable you to be ready to apply for jobs like the one you want.

1. Project management (whole project)
2. Extensive background research in both literature (some of the ideas have a starting paper or two linked) and inspiration (layouts, fonts, colours, features).
3. Understanding of research and development methodologies and how they are linked (decide on which ones you will use.. It will a number not less than 3).
4. Primary research and analysis that informs the requirements of the build
5. Plan and use version control
6. Website or app content gathering and creation
7. Design of the interface (experiments - lots of experiments (font choices, colour choice, to create a style guide) layout structure, information architecture, )
8. Design (calls to action identification - user stories, personas, customer story mapping, ( https://uxplanet.org/my-10-step-ux-ui-workflow-2019-74bb78723414 )
9. Build of artefact (semantic HTML, CSS grid + sub-grid, dynamic data source (from cms you build, API or a structured JSON file).
10. Technical Testing (TDD/BDD, user testing, expert testing, performance testing (chrome dev tools and lighthouse, accessibility testing)
11. Post-build research to see if the site works for the purpose designed (not technicall but objectively (Does the site meet your aim and objectives?)
12. Final analysis
13. Write up (latex - using overleaf, refs in bib file from google scholar)

## Top Tip
#### The build should be much more than you have ever been asked to do or done in any other module.
