# Project Brief 

This site can be either PHP or JS based but has a frontend tutorial user interface and
backend tutor settings panel.
You should develop a detailed step by step tutorial site to teach modern web design theory
and practice to prospective uni students on a visit day (practical exercise should not take a
prospective student more than 3 hours to complete but by the end they should have a good
basic knowledge of layout, grid design as well as HTML CSS (CSS-grid) coding.
The final app/site should be something that looks professional but represents Edge Hill
university. Ideally, this tool will have multiple options set so the tutor can turn things on and
off in the tutor dashboard and as these change the tutorial (text and instruction) and end
design changes. E.g. if the CSS grid option is turned off then there is an alternative CSS fall
back in place that changes in the tutorial but the layout stays the same. But if a banner is
turned off then the layout changes as does the tutorial. For this, you need to think modular
in both the tutorial system and the make-up of your CSS and tutorial parts.

<div class="text-block">
3) Understanding of research and development methodologies and how they are linked.
(decide on which ones you will use.. It will a number not less than 3)
</div>
<div class="text-block">
4) Primary research and analysis that informs the requirements of the build

<div class="text-block">
5) Plan and use version control
</div>
<div class="text-block">
6) Website or app content gathering and creation
</div>
<div class="text-block">

</div>
<div class="text-block">

cms you build, API or a structured JSON file)
</div>
<div class="text-block">
10) Technical Testing (TDD/BDD, user testing, expert testing, performance testing
(chrome dev tools and lighthouse, accessibility testing)
</div>
<div class="text-block">
11) Post-build research to see if the site works for the purpose designed (not technically
but objectively (Does the site meet your aim and objectives?)
</div>
<div class="text-block">
12) Final analysis
</div>
<div class="text-block">
13) Write up (latex - using overleaf, refs in bib file from google scholar)
